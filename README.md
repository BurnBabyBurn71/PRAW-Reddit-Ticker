In order to use this scipt you will need to install PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) on to your Python install. You will also need to add the CSS provided in this repo onto your subreddit CSS for the styling. The CSS is build for the /r/BytecoinBCN and /r/Quazarcoin subreddits and therefore will need to be modified to suit the needs of your subreddit. Furthermore, if you want a self-updating ticker for your subreddit you will have to use Windows task scheduler to run the script every x minutes.
